# Geoguesser

## What is it?

Geoguesser is a browser game that drops you in a random location around the world and has you try and guess where you are located. After 5 rounds your score is totalled and added to a leaderboard. Try playing the game here: https://geoguesser.dev

## What about Geoguessr?

We are big fans of the original Geoguessr game and that is what inspired this version.
